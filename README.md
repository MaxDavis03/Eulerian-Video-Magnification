# Eulerian-Video-Magnification
This repository uses the work done by MIT researchers Neal Wadhwa, Michael Rubinstein, Fredo Durand and William T. Freeman in 2014 in a paper titled 'Riesz pyramids for fast phase-based video magnification,' and translates their MATLAB code implementation into a more versatile python library. The library is intended to be used in modern computer vision systems alongside tools such as OpenCV. 

Please read the original papers in 'Research Papers' folder to see the work of the original researchers. All credit for the functionality of the code in this repository and the video magnification method goes to the original authors of the uploaded papers.
