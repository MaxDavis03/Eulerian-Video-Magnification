# Eulerian-Video-Magnification
This repository uses the work done by MIT researchers Neal Wadhwa, Michael Rubinstein, Fredo Durand and William T. Freeman in 2014 in a paper titled 'Riesz pyramids for fast phase-based video magnification,' and translates their MATLAB code implementation into a more versatile python library.
